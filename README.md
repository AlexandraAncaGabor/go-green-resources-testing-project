Go green resources is a web page that presents the problems that Maramures county is facing at the moment. It is a non-guvernamental site were the owners of this are describing the environmental issues of Maramures county. Also you have the opportunity to be a sponsor or volunteer through a contract. 


I decided to test it because it's the page of one of my friend and I wanted to help her find the issues and help me too to practice more. Also, I was always concerned about Maramures environmental issues, because there is were I live.
